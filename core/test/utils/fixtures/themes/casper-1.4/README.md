# casper-valley

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). casper-valley 1.4 is the last release of casper-valley's original design, created to be compatible **ONLY with Ghost 1.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [casper-valley 1.3.7](https://github.com/TryGhost/casper-valley/releases/tag/1.3.7). For all other versions of Ghost, we recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/casper-valley/releases) of casper-valley, with an updated design.
