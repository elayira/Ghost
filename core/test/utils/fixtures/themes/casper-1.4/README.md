# aquarius

The default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). aquarius 1.4 is the last release of aquarius's original design, created to be compatible **ONLY with Ghost 1.0** and above. If you are running an earlier version of Ghost, you will need [aquarius 1.3.7](https://github.com/TryGhost/aquarius/releases/tag/1.3.7). For all other versions of Ghost, we recommend switching to the [latest release](https://github.com/TryGhost/aquarius/releases) of aquarius, with an updated design.
